                        Gospel is the good news about Jesus that gives knowledge of Salvation by the remission of our sins. This gospel is well revealed through the four gospel books in the New Testament. The study of the introduction to the Gospels teaches about the life of Jesus Christ. The students will be able to learn in detail about the birth, ministry, signs, parables, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ as witnessed by his disciples in the four gospel books.

                        Through the study of the introduction to the gospels, we get to know the work that Jesus did for us and the heart of Jesus. When we connect our hearts with Jesus, the life of Jesus will be manifested in us. We will also do the ministry that God is pleased with and be the true disciples to witness the works of Jesus.

                        Jesus that was prophesied eventually was revealed and came into the world through the Virgin Mary as it was prophesied many centuries before his birth. While Matthew describes Jesus as King as Jeremiah prophesied "…that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and the king shall reign" (Jeremiah 23:5), Mark shows how Jesus came to us as a servant. Zechariah had prophesied, "…for behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH (Zechariah 3:8). Luke in the manner of Zechariah reveals Jesus as a man, "…..behold, the man whose name is THE BRANCH" (Zechariah 6:12). The disciples that lived with Jesus in His ministry are the very infallible eyewitnesses that the whole world needs to heed in order to take God at His word. These disciples echoed what they heard from Jesus and it is in their writings that the sermons and words from the mouth of Jesus are recorded.

                        Therefore, he who studies the Gospels can only be one with Jesus. Through the Gospels, we gain the salvation of our soul and ultimately establish a right relationship with God before we get into the heavenly kingdom prepared for us and forever live with Him in His glory. Paul in Timothy says, "The Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus" (2 Timothy 3:15)

                    The Book of John
                </h2>
                <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <p>
                        There are four books of the gospel in the New Testament: Mathew, Mark, Luke, and John.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The books of Mathew, Mark, and Luke are referred to as Synoptic gospel. It is because the same words of Jesus especially the parables are overlapped. This is so because they are seen from a common perspective and termed as synoptic gospel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Written by Apostle John, the youngest of the disciples, the book of John is considered as a special scripture among the four gospels. John describes Jesus Christ as one who came as God. Therefore, it is noted that this book has a special meaning unlike the other three.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is a purpose for recording the book of John. The book itself explains why it was recorded in John 20:30, 31.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many signs and wonders in this book but the main purpose is for us to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the son of God and that by believing in him, ye might have eternal life through his name. This word explains how the gospel of John was recorded. It explains the gospel in detail and a direct sermon of Jesus who delivers to us precisely the words of life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apostle John played a big role in the Jerusalem church bringing big progress of the gospel. His brother was James and John was the son of Zebedee and his mother was Salome. The parents appear in the bible many times until the death of Jesus. This is a precious family that feared God and served the Lord. With that, we can say Apostle John played a pivotal role in the Bible and in the Jerusalem church.

                        The unmistakable truth about forgiveness of sin is hidden as a secret in the Bible. Through learning this subject, this truth is unveiled, and just as the light shone upon Saul and changed the light of the gospel shines in our hearts and great change occurs in our lives. It is the power that makes people break free from sin, lust, desires, addiction and live a bright happy life.
