                            There are two things that Moses received from God when he went to Mount Sinai. He received the law made of 613 commandments and the plan of the Holy Tabernacle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The children of Israel just like any descendant of Adam were not able to keep the law of God despite their promises. After they had broken the law they had to be forgiven of their sins by giving sacrificial offerings to God in the Holy Tabernacle. Those offerings were foreshadowing Jesus Christ the Savior who would come into the World and the once for all sacrifice for the sin of mankind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is therefore a concrete reason as to why God gave the Holy Tabernacle to children of Israel. When God asked the children of Israel to bring an offering in Exodus 25:3~7 the purpose was to build a shining house here on earth, a place where there is no sin at all so that God could dwell together with them, so that God could meet together with the children of Israel in there and have their sins washed. In other words, this tabernacle is a source of blessing to the Israelites, a place for deliverance from sin. Psalm 5:4 for thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness, neither shall evil dwell with thee.

                            The students of the book of Exodus will gain a clear picture of Jesus and the temple of God will be established in their hearts. They will connect the sacrifices offered in the Old Testament and the only sacrifice for sin that was given through Jesus.

                            Spiritual life is exactly discovering God's heart and live by that heart. The very moment one discovers the heart and the plan of God in his life can take rest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is that rest that we wish to see fulfilled in the hearts of the students that are enrolled in this class. God who created heaven and the earth will create a new heart in us. God who created the world is responsible for everything and everyone in the world. Him being responsible, he would like us to rest. However, Satan wants to distort the rest in our hearts. Through the lessons in Genesis, the students will return to the life of the Garden of Eden, and God's heart will be established in their lives.

                        The Book of Matthew

                        <p>
                            The book of Matthew is the first Gospel book in the New Testament. It brings about a clear record of the life and the ministry of Jesus. In Matthew, Jesus teaches people what it means to be part of his kingdom, the "kingdom of heaven." He is betrayed and crucified. He rises again and commissions His disciples to spread the good news.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Matthew presents Jesus as the Messiah, the promised descendant of King David who would bring God's kingdom to earth and establish a time of peace and justice. Matthew quotes the Old Testament extensively and places special emphasis on Jesus' fulfillment of prophecies—which would have been important to a Jewish audience. Matthew tells us the story of Jesus with an emphasis on His role as Messiah, or Christ.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Gospel According to Matthew is the first book of the New Testament of the Bible and one of the three synoptic gospels. It tells how Israel's Messiah, rejected and executed in Israel, pronounces judgment on Israel and its leaders and becomes the Salvation of the gentiles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Gospel of Matthew is especially important for it is one of the two Gospels originally written by an apostle of Jesus about 80-90 AD. The Gospel of Matthew was possibly written in Antioch an early home of Christianity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The gospel of Matthew stresses that Jesus is the Christ foretold in Hebrew scripture, the Old Testament. For example, Jesus fulfills the prophecies of Isaiah 7:14 that the Lord is to be born a virgin and Micah 5:2 that the Lord is to be born in Bethlehem. He was named "Jesus because he will save his people from their sins" (Matthew 1:21). Yeshua, his very name in Hebrew means "The Lord saves". Jesus grew up in Nazareth of Galilee and was called a Nazarene (Matthew 2:23). Jesus calls himself the son of man 30 times, fulfilling the destiny of the Messianic figure in Daniel 7:13. He is called the son of David 9 times in the Gospel of Matthew.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Just as the 12 sons of Jacob were the origin of the 12 tribes of Israel, Jesus as Christ chose 12 apostles to inaugurate the Kingdom of heaven.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The gospel begins with the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. This clearly shows the genealogy of the Kings. Thus the Gospel of Matthew is commonly termed as the book of King. Matthew 2:2 "Where is he that is born king of the Jews?"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The unique character of the book of Matthew is that it describes Jesus as the King, not only of the Jews but also the king of our hearts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through the study of the Gospel of Matthew the students will be able to clearly understand how Jesus became the Messiah and the king in our heart, live in obedience to his word, and live a blessed, peaceful, and Victorious life by the King.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the students learn through Matthew, Jesus the son of God and the King of Kings will be established in their hearts and the very works that Jesus accomplished 2000 years ago will be manifested in their lives. They will receive the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of God in their hearts. Ultimately, they will become true disciples who are laboring to make other disciples for Jesus in order to fulfill His command.

                            The focus of the "righteousness of God" is fundamental throughout the book of Romans. In fact, it is threaded through every section of the basic outline of this epistle. Paul reiterates this so that the reader may realize that salvation cannot be attained through man's good deeds but only through faith in God's righteousness: "I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes... For in the gospel the righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith" (1:16-17).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You cannot repair your relationship with God through your good deeds; this is only accomplished through faith in the perfect and finished work of Jesus Christ.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the students learn the book of Romans, they cease from their own expectations about what they should or should not do. Through Romans, the word of God empowers them to surrender to the Lord, their ideas, limitations, and preferences and are instead filled with the supernatural power and are endowed gifts that are of paramount importance not only for individual growth but also for the growth of the church they belong to. Thus they can become useful tools in the hand of God gifted and empowered to spread the Good News.
